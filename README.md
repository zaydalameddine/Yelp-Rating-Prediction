# Yelp Rating Prediction
 
In this project, I have taken data from Yelp in order to use multiple linear regression to predict the rating of a restuarant given other features about it

I also:
- Used the pandas python library to create dataframes which held the data from the .csv files
- Normalized the data and plotted the independent variables against the dependent
- Compared different coefficient values to see which variables held the most weight on the dependent variable
- Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets
- Evaluated the accuracy of the model by calculating the coefficient of the determinant of R2
